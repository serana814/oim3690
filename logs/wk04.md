# Session 07 & 08 - Feb 10, 2026 & Feb 12, 2026

## What I Learned This Week
- An image does not have an end tag because an image doesn't have text inside it, meaning that an end tag is not necessary
- Using the keys "control + i" allows you to change a certain line of code using AI to generate more code for you
- Inline suggestions aren't recommended for use because often times they have code that is outdated
- using SVG you can use code to draw shapes
- the left of the "=" is the name of the attribute and everything combined is the attribute 
- CSS controls how things look (color, font, etc.)
- HTML: controls the actual content of the page (text, headers, etc.) 
- Javascript: controls the behavior (what makes a button click)

## Code I'm proud of (Optional)
- None this week

## Challenges I Faced
- I was having some trouble with adding images to the code as it was not working
- I managed to fix it at the end of class but I spent much of the class confused since I missed what came after while I was trying to figure it out 
- Finally, the last challenge that I faced was that I missed a class because I woke up sick, so I had to catch up on content based on notes from a friend. 

## AI Usage 
- I asked AI to help me improve my "About Me" page
- I used it to make some changes to my code to make everything more professional as if I was using it as a resume. 
- I asked AI to also add more sections to my about me page specific to my life and what I wanted to portray about myself

## Questions for Going Forward
