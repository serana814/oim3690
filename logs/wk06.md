# Session 10 & 11 - Feb 24 & Feb 26 - Basic Selectors



## What I Learned This Week
### Tuesday, Feb 24
- Adding "!Important" overrides any other code that may conflict with that one
- Why is extrernal CSS styles recommended over inline code?
    - Easier to apply to many different pages and have the same exact style in each of them
- selectors can be used to select all of a certain type of item in order to keep the code for them and the style the same
- use "span" (<>) to select and edit only a small piece from a larger text 
- 0 auto means 0 pixels up and down and auto means the same space away from the left and from the right
#### Pseudo Classes & Transitions
- Use ":" instead of "." for Pseudo Class
- hover: what shows up when your mouse hovers over a link or anything
- First and last child elements: 
#### CSS Variables
- Define it once and use it everywhere 
- For example: Define what Babson Green is and then just type that in everywhere that you need it

#### Score on CSS Diner

### Thursday, Feb 26
- With fit content (in CSS) you don't need to specify how many pixels, it will center it for you 
- To have a color show up in multiple places but you only want to change it once: Assign that color a name and have that name in all places and put it in the root code
