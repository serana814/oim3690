#session 05 - Feb 3, 2026 - HTML essentials

##what I learned today
- we don't just use the IP address because it is hard to remember --> much easier to remember a URL and dns translates it into IP address
- when you view a webpage, your browser downloads HTML files 
- GET = when you ask a server to show you information (ex: pull up a website)
- POST = when you give the server something (ex: create an account or fill out a form)
    - post is not cached for privacy reasons
- use "inspect" to see website codes & learn from other websites

Anatomy of a URL
- babson.edu = domain only (goes to default page)
- babson.edu/about = goes to about page
- babson.edu/about/ = Folder (usually shows index)

- IP V4 was not enough for the amount of devices in the world
- IP V6 was created to have more IP addresses

##Challenges I faced
- One challenge I faced was getting the right prompt to ask AI in order to understand the difference between GET and POST but ended up getting to the correct result in the end
