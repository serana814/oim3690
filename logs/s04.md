# session 04 - Jan 29, 2026 - How Web Works

## What I learned Today
- DNS = Domain name system
- you type in a website (ex: www.babson.edu) and dns translates it into an IP address (ex: 166.117.19.175)
- HTTP = Hyper text transfer protocol (defines the way in which computers talk to eachother)
- browser sends a request to the server (GET)
- GET = retrieve data (loading a page)
- POST = send data (ex: submitting a form or creating an account)
- server sends back a response 
- status codes:
    - 200 = OK
    - 404 = not found
    - 500 = server error
- demo = what the browser downloads

## Challenges I faced
- Honestly I really understood the content of this class and don't think I had any challenges
