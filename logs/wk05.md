## Questions for Going Forward

## NOTES
- Keep writing learning logs
- keep building and improving personal website
- mini project 1: find client and start "proposal.md" 
    - wants a real PRD (proposal requirement document)
    - Goal is to have meaningful progress by Checkpoint 2

- 3 ways to add CSS to a page 
    1. Internal: In the same file (inside the HTML in head) (Use the style tag to start)
    2. Inline: add the style inside the tab 
    3. Other document
    - better if you add all of the style code in one place instead of within each line so that it is easier to manage by either you or AI
- Cascading in CSS: Multiple rules can exist for the same element (determined by priority and order) 
    - The order in which the code is displayed. (Internal and external) 
    - the inline will override the external and internal
