# Session 09 - Feb 19 - CSS Essentials

## What I Learned This Week
- 3 ways to add CSS to a page 
    1. Internal: In the same file (inside the HTML in head) (Use the style tag to start)
    2. Inline: add the style inside the tab 
    3. Other document
    - better if you add all of the style code in one place instead of within each line so that it is easier to manage by either you or AI
- Cascading in CSS: Multiple rules can exist for the same element (determined by priority and order) 
    - The order in which the code is displayed. (Internal and external) 
    - the inline will override the external and internal 
- basic selectors: 
    - element --> targets all elements of a type --> p{}
    - class --> targets all elements in a class --> .intro {}
    - ID --> targets elements with ID --> #header {}
    - Universal --> targets all elements --> * {}
- selector specificity (from lowest to highest)
    - Element selectors (p, div, h1)
    - Class selectors (.intro, .btn)
    - ID selectors (#header, #main)
    - Inline styles (styles="...")
- If you want to try new fornts, go to Google fonts to find many more options 
- The box model: every element is a box (in order from inside to outside)
    - Content: the actual content
    - Padding: the space between the border and the content
    - Border: The edge
    - Margin: The space outside the border 

## Code I'm proud of (Optional)

## Challenges I Faced
- This week I continued to catch up on the work that was done in class last week when I was absent. Therefore, it was a little challenging for me to follow along since I had not fully understood the content that was covered. 

## AI Usage 
- I used AI to understant certain lines of code from last week that I had not yet understood or had missed. This was very helpful because I felt as though the class was moving very quickly and I was not undertsanding some important information. 
- I also used AI to help me build some CSS code to change the font and color styles of some of the text on my demo page. 

## Questions for Going Forward
- N/A

## Other Notes
- Keep writing learning logs
- keep building and improving personal website
- mini project 1: find client and start "proposal.md" 
    - wants a real PRD (proposal requirement document)
    - Goal is to have meaningful progress by Checkpoint 2
